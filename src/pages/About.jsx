          My full name is Arshvir Sandhu. I am currently a sophmore student at San Diego State University
          studying Computer Engineering. After my freshman year, I decided to get ahead and start working on leetcode
          and coding projects on the side. I had the idea that I needed to start building an impressive resume and work
          on problem-solving skills through leetcode. I got interested in tech and programming since highschool
          and taking my first Computer Science class. In addition to that, I've always loved computers and playing
          video games which sparked my curiosity into how all these things were organized and made. As of right
          now I have developed skills in the following languages: Python, Java, C, C++ with my strongest being Python.
          I also have experience working with React + Vite and solving Leetcode problems.
