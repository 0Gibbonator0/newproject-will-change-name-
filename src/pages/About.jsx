          My full name is Arshvir Sandhu. I am currently a sophmore student at San Diego State University
          studying Computer Engineering. After my freshman year, I decided to get ahead and start working on leetcode
          and coding projects on the side. I had the idea that I needed to start building an impressive resume and work
          on problem-solving skills through leetcode. I got interested in tech and programming since highschool
          and taking my first Computer Science class. In addition to that, I've always loved computers and playing
          video games which sparked my curiosity into how all these things were organized and made. As of right
          now I have developed skills in the following languages: Python, Java, C, C++ with my strongest being Python.
          I also have experience working with React + Vite and solving Leetcode problems.

          My goal is to become a full time software engineer in big tech. I've become so intrigued with 
          coding since it involves lots of problem solving skills. Playing video games and dealing
          with puzzles and solving problems has also inspired my desire to become someone who thinks more outside the box.
          I also dream to work in New York City, that has always been my dream city that I want to live while pursing 
          my career. I also hope to contribute to the world through software development and innovation.
          I strongly believe in the positive effect technology has had in our lives and the world, and I love that working a job
          which involves improving and creating software is going to be my career. I want to improve people's lives
          and the world with better tech.
